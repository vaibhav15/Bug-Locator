Minor Project - Help Locating bug/errors/exceptions

First user is asked to upload his project

Then the bug report is taken from the user and words are taken from it ,which may provide useful information

Keywords from the bug report are searched in directories and file names .
Then the code itself will be searched for similar class/function names 

A list of most probable locations of the bug will be generated using this method.
